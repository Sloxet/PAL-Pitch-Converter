# PAL Pitch Converter

PAL Pitch Converter is a user-friendly web application which corrects the speed of your audio and video files to comply with the PAL standard. PAL (Phase Alternating Line) is a standard for analog television broadcasts used in numerous countries. Typically, films and specific U.S. broadcasts are recorded at 24 frames per second, a standard established in the early days of cinema. In PAL regions where the television broadcast frame rate is 25 fps, content needs a 1.466% speed adjustment to match the standard. By using this converter, your content becomes compatible with PAL standards, making it suitable for television broadcast and playback without any noticeable timing differences.
